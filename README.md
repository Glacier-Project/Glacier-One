# Glacier-One
Hardware design for the Glacier One test platform.

## About the Glacier One
The Glacier One is meant to serve as a reference design for a basic Glacier OS mobile phone, allowing for development of new devices and form factors to be easy.

## Design Considerations
The hope is to make the design meet a few basic goals:
- Ease of Manufacturing: The devices should be easy to build and repair, using off-the-shelf modules where possible (without affecting usability).
- Modularity: The different subsystems in the device should not be so tightly integrated that they are difficult to completely replace if needed.

## Design Stages
### T0
- `Rev 1` - First breadboard prototype of the Glacier One. Handwired.
- `Rev 2` - First PCB prototype of the Glacier One. Still uses off-the-shelf display and cellular modules. The Rev 2 prototypes are *still in manufacturing* and are currently untested.

### EVT
There are currently no EVT-stage designs.

### DVT
There are currently no DVT-stage designs.

### PVT
There are currently no PVT-stage designs.
